// 🚀 Welcome to the Variables Module! 🚀

// Let's declare some variables:

// 🍎 An apple a day keeps the errors away! 🍏
let fruit = "apple";

// ☕️ Time for a coffee break! ☕️
let beverage = "coffee";

// 🎲 Roll the dice! 🎲
let diceNumber = 6;

// 🌈 Colors of the rainbow! 🌈
let color = "blue";

// Now, let's do some variable gymnastics:

// 🔄 Reassigning variables is like changing outfits! 🧥
fruit = "banana";

// 🤖 Variables can be as dynamic as a robot dance! 🕺
let dynamicVariable = 42;
dynamicVariable = "I can be a string too!";

// 💫 Let's mix and match data types! 🍹
let mixedVariable = "hello" + "world";
mixedVariable = 42 + " is the answer";

// 🚨 Watch out for the tricky typeof operator! 🕵️‍♂️
let mysteriousVariable = true;
console.log(typeof mysteriousVariable); // Spoiler alert: It's a boolean!

// 🌍 Variables can travel across functions! 🚢
function travelFunction() {
  let localVariable = "I'm local!";
  console.log(localVariable);
}

// 🧩 Commenting out variables is like hiding them in a puzzle! 🧩
// let hiddenVariable = "You can't see me!";

// 🎉 Hooray! You've mastered the Variables Module! 🎉
